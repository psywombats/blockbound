TO RUN:
If you're on Windows, run Blockbound.exe. If you're on something else, run
Blockbound.jar either by double clicking it or java -jar Blockbound.jar and then
crossing your fingers. Let me know if you have trouble on a specific OS.

OPTIONS:
If you want to play in fullscreen mode, change "false" in blockbound.cfg to
"true." It's magic.

REPORTING PROBLEMS:
If you notice something odd, please post on the RMN page or contact me.
